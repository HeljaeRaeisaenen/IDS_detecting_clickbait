# Detecting clickbait in news headlines

The notebook file is hard to read on Github, I recommend downloading it and opening it in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode. Our results should be easy to reproduce by running this notebook.

The files in the data folder are scraped from The Wayback Machine over an approximate period of 2 months, from August 2nd to October 2nd. This was done by modifying the URL field with the URL to The Wayback Machine's archive for that particular date. However if The Wayback Machine did not have an archive for a given date, archives for additional dates before and after the set dates were included. Therefore, each .csv file should reflect a roughly equivalent period of time. Even though the number of lines differs, this is due to individual websites having more headlines than others.

All of the data in the data folder consists of publicly available information. The data is being used only for research purposes.
